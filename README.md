# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game is also known by various other names, including noughts and crosses, Xs and Os, or simply "Tic Tac" in some regions. The name "noughts and crosses" comes from the fact that one player traditionally uses circles (noughts) as their marker, while the other uses crosses (crosses). The name "Xs and Os" comes from the fact that these are the most common symbols used to represent the players' markers.

In some regions, the game is also known by other names, such as "tit-tat-toe" or "tick-tack-toe". Regardless of the name, the game is a simple and enjoyable way to pass the time while also exercising strategic thinking and visualization skills.
